	<section id="aboutMe">
	I  am a Front-End developer with an interest in design as well. I am experienced in creating responsive mobile-first websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While I do consider myself a front-end developer, I do have back-end experience using PHP and MySQL. I am eager to add to my knowledge by learning new languages and frameworks to enhance my ability as a developer and designer. I would love to join a team to showcase my ability, as well as learn from and collaborate with fellow developers.
